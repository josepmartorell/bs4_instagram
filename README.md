Instagram is a social network and a mobile application at the same time which allows you to upload images and videos with multiple photographic effects to later share them on the same platform.  

This application allows to extract those images with their respective subtitles to later analyze them using AWS Recognition classifying and ordering the material by folders.   

Make responsible use.
